https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/33105/
Questions/comments 

This document is to gather questions/comments to the various talk to be discussed at the final discussion or to be followed up after the workshop. Please indicate your name with your initials.

General comments/questions:



Questions/Comments to talks:


Spectroscopy Theory: progress and open questions from a lattice point of view
MW: Sasa: discrimination between close to threshold, well above threshold, one-channel, couple-channel scattering
MW: sasa: Di-baryon with heavy quarks well accessible with LQCD, prediction of bound state well below threshold
MW: full shopping list in Sasa’s talk of potential interesting combinations of hadron-pair combinations involving charm and beauty


Femtoscopy concepts and information from femtoscopy related to spectroscopy
MW: Limitations/assumptions that go into the usage of the Schrödionger equation?
MW: Calibration with protons, alternatives?
MW: limitation by source modeling, but access to ‘all’ channels




First measurement D-h interaction from femtoscopy with ALICE
Ivan P: (on slide 31) In the Tcc->D0D0pi+ decay the D*+ is not on-shell, but D0pi+ mass is typically ~5*Gamma(D*+) lower than D*+ mass. How then k* between D0 and (pseudo-)D*+ is going to be determined? And how can one mimic such off-shell D*+ in mixed events while calculating C(k*) function?
[I apologize that I couldn’t ask it during the talk itself]
MW: we will discuss it after your talk
KM: question/comment on assumptions and method used to estimate “non-femto” correlated background (called “jet-induced” in the talk). Rather than calling this “jet-induced”, to me this is more “fragmentation-induced” as not every parton shower necessarily results in what we would experimentally call a jet, but parton showers can and do of course produce correlations. I don’t know exactly how the background is determined, but depending on your jet definition to me it seems like you could be missing correlated background from production in the parton shower not leading to a jet. Have you considered this? Also, jet substructure measurements are now measuring similar correlations (there are many observables, I don’t think D-pi has been measured yet specifically) in jets which are often not well described by MC. So to me the estimation of this “jet-induced, non-femto” background seems heavily model-dependent and relies on a lot of assumptions. It seems to me you are assuming that any correlated non-femto background is produced in a jet, which to a first-order approximation is probably reasonable, but I don’t think is entirely correct.

Hadronisation and (de)confinement in hadronic collisions: what to learn from or about exotica?

MW: coalescence on quark or on hadron level
MW: what does it mean that statistical hadronization works  on microscopic level. 
MW: critics on flow
Fabrizio: nuclei formation SHM not working in small systems. 

Valentina: p-d correlation not working based on nucleon-nucleon interactions only
VMS: additional femto studies for light-hadron exotics:
a0(980) with K0sKch in Pb-Pb and pp: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04929 , https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07899 
a0(980) and f0(980) in pp: https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06611 
→ interesting theo study on the same data by Oset et al: https://inspirehep.net/literature/2738555 
K0*(700) in K0sπch in pp: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12830 


Concepts of amplitude analysis

VMS: How do you typically model the NR part? Is it just background? Phase space?
Should I observe a NR contribution coming from the interaction in spectroscopy spectra and how much does this could affect the extraction of states properties?
