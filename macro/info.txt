Rebin(n) command in root, merges the the n number of bins in the total bins. For Example, If a histogram has 20 bins, then Rebin(4) merges 4 bins i.e. there will be total 20/4 bins in the resulting histogram.

chi square fit is done to check that which function gives the best fit to the data points.

All the variables in the common.h file are started from k, just to make the macro easier to read.

Only the mixed events are normalized because in mixed events, 5-10 events are taken, so they add up to a bigger value which needs to be scaled for subtraction with the signal. In like sign background the background is almost on the sawe scale as the signal.

In the signal without peak histogram, the histogram is first cloned from the (signal - background) histogram and then bins are set to 0 for the range in which there is a peak, so we get signal without peak.
